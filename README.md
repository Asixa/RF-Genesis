## Updates 2025!
Sorry for the long wait â€” the RFLoRA model is finally released! Feel free to try it out.

Please note that RFLoRA was a workaround developed back in 2023, before 3D diffusion models became available. In 2025, Iâ€™ll be adding support for 3D diffusion models for indoor room generation.

Also, Iâ€™ve noticed that some dependencies, including MDM and Mitsuba, have updated their APIs. Iâ€™ll start maintaining this project again while also preparing for RFGenV2!



## News
ðŸ“¢ **June/25** - RFLoRA model released, trained under 20k images!

ðŸ“¢ **June/25** - Experimental CUDA kernel for signal generation, reduce memory usage by 1000X!

ðŸ“¢ **22/Jan/24** - Initial Release of RF Genesis!

ðŸ“¢ **29/March/24** - Added the code for point-cloud processing and visualization.

## To-Do List
- [ ]  **New**  Replace Mitsuba with custom rayTracing engines.
- [ ]  **New**  3D Diffusion including indoor environments.
- [ ] More documentations.


## Quick Start
This code was tested on `Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS` and requires:

* Python 3.10
* conda3 or miniconda3
* CUDA capable GPU (one is enough)


Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Asixa/RF-Genesis.git
cd RF-Genesis
```

Create a conda environment.
```
conda create -n rfgen python=3.10 -y 
conda activate rfgen
```
Install python packages
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
sh setup.sh
```
Run a simple example.
```
python run.py -o "a person walking back and forth" -e "a living room" -n "hello_rfgen"
```

Optional Command:

Skiping visualization rendering
```
--no-visualize 
```
Skiping environmental diffusion
```
--no-environment 
```

## RFLoRA

```
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import torch
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Load model
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("darkstorm2150/Protogen_x5.3_Official_Release",
    torch_dtype=torch.float16,
    safety_checker=None,
).to("cuda")

pipe.load_lora_weights("Asixa/RFLoRA")

prompt = "a living room with a table, a chair, a TV, a computer, a lamp, a plant, a window, a door" 
image = pipe(prompt, num_inference_steps=25).images[0]
plt.imshow(image)
```




## Visualization

Rendered SMPL animation and radar point clouds. 


## Radar Hardware
The current simulation is based on the model of [**Texas Instruments AWR 1843**](https://www.ti.com/product/AWR1843#all) radar, with 3TX 4RX MIMO setup. 
![TI1843](https://github.com/Asixa/RF-Genesis/assets/22312333/bf68a6df-a3d2-4889-a7eb-509caf52a2fb)

The radar configuration is shown in [TI1843.json](https://github.com/Asixa/RF-Genesis/blob/main/models/TI1843_config.json) and it can be freely adjusted.
