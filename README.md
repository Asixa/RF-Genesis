## News
ðŸ“¢ **22/Jan/24** - Initial Release of RF Genesis!

## To-Do List
- [ ] Release the RFLoRA pretrained model.
- [ ] Release the RFLoRA training dataset and procedures.


## Quick Start
This code was tested on `Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS` and requires:

* Python 3.10
* conda3 or miniconda3
* CUDA capable GPU (one is enough)


Clone the repository
```
git clone git@github.com:Asixa/RF-Genesis.git
```
Download the dependencies [*RFGen_Dependencies.zip*](https://ucsdcloud-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/xic063_ucsd_edu/EWUa1yi8V-RKrs2mYwWgom8B5ezkctME6_W_nkSc10iDLg?e=tbVhfX) and drop it to the root folder 
**without unzipping it**.

Create a conda environment.
```
conda conda create -n rfgen python=3.10 -y 
conda activate rfgen
```
Install python packages
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
sh setup.sh
```
Run a simple example.
```
python run.py -o "a person walking back and forth" -e "a living room" -n "hello_rfgen"
```
