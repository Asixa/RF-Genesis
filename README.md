## News
ðŸ“¢ **22/Jan/24** - Initial Release of RF Genesis!

ðŸ“¢ **29/March/24** - Added the code for point-cloud processing and visualization.

## To-Do List
- [ ] Release the RFLoRA pretrained model.
- [ ] Release the RFLoRA training dataset and procedures.
- [ ] More documentations.


## Quick Start
This code was tested on `Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS` and requires:

* Python 3.10
* conda3 or miniconda3
* CUDA capable GPU (one is enough)


Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Asixa/RF-Genesis.git
cd RF-Genesis
```

Create a conda environment.
```
conda create -n rfgen python=3.10 -y 
conda activate rfgen
```
Install python packages
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
sh setup.sh
```
Run a simple example.
```
python run.py -o "a person walking back and forth" -e "a living room" -n "hello_rfgen"
```
## Visualization

Rendered SMPL animation and radar point clouds. 

**Credits**: The point cloud algorithm is borrowed  from [mmMesh](https://github.com/HavocFiXer/mmMesh).

## Radar Hardware
The current simulation is based on the model of [**Texas Instruments AWR 1843**](https://www.ti.com/product/AWR1843#all) radar, with 3TX 4RX MIMO setup. 
![TI1843](https://github.com/Asixa/RF-Genesis/assets/22312333/bf68a6df-a3d2-4889-a7eb-509caf52a2fb)

The radar configuration is shown in [TI1843.json](https://github.com/Asixa/RF-Genesis/blob/main/models/TI1843_config.json) and it can be freely adjusted.
